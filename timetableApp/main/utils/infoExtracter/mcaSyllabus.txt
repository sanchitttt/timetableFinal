SYLLABUS
List of Programs as Assignments:
Objective: To Understand and Implement basic OOP features
1.Write a Program to design a class having static member function named showcount()
which has the property of displaying the number of objects created of the class.
2. Write a Program which creates & uses array of object of a class.( for eg. implementing
the list of Managers of a Company having details such as Name, Age, etc..).

(derived class of student) representing the scores of the student in various subjects and
sports class representing the score in sports. The sports and test class should be inherited by
a result class having the functionality to add the scores and display the final result for a
student.
11.Write a Program illustrating how the constructors are implemented and the order in
which they are called when the classes are inherited. Use three classes named alpha, beta,
gamma such that alpha, beta are base class and gamma is derived class inheriting alpha &
beta.

and weight from the keyboard and to store them on a specified file using read() and write()
functions. Again the same file is opened for reading and displaying the contents of the file
on the screen.
14.Write a program to perform the deletion of white spaces such as horizontal tab, vertical
tab, space ,linefeed ,new line and carriage return from a text file and store the contents of
the file without the white spaces on another file.
